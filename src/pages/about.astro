        <strong>Hi, I’m Vincent Ooi.</strong> Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
    </p>

    <p>
        By day, I’m navigating the world of technology and small business efficiency; by night, I’m usually soldering something or debugging a workflow that <em>definitely</em> worked five minutes ago.
    </p>

    <h3>The Tech Obsession</h3>

    <p>
        I have a slight obsession with <strong>mesh networking</strong>. While most people pack extra snacks for a hike, I’m usually packing Heltec v3 nodes to see if I can create an off-grid communication text network in the wilderness. There’s just something magical about sending a message through thin air without paying a carrier fee (and without the NSA reading it).
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m also a big believer in <strong>automation</strong> (specifically <strong>n8n</strong>). I believe humans are too creative to be stuck doing copy-paste work. If a computer can do it, I’ll find a way to make it do it—so I can spend more time doing important things. Like hiking. Or fixing the mesh node I broke while hiking.
    </p>

    <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>

    <p>
        This blog is where I document the chaos. You’ll find:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Guides on building your own <strong>LoRa communicators</strong>.</li>
        <li>Deep dives into <strong>business automation</strong> and self-hosting.</li>
        <li>The occasional rant about code that refuses to compile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to grab a schematic, copy a workflow, and build something cool.
