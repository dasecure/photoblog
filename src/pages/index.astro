			<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Vincent.</h1>
			
			<p>
				Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is a <strong>digital garden</strong>—a collection of notes, projects, and photographs designed to grow over time.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am currently based in Sunnyvale, working at <strong>dasecure</strong>. My work focuses on hardware security and technology, but my curiosity extends much further.
			</p>

			<h3>📷 Photography</h3>
			<p>
				When I'm not at a keyboard, I am usually behind a lens. I shoot wildlife and astrophotography using an <strong>Olympus OM-1</strong>. You can find my field notes here or check out my gallery on <a href="https://instagram.com/vooiphotography" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>🛠️ Engineering & Projects</h3>
			<p>
				I believe in building things that last. This site is built on a "best of breed" static architecture to ensure it survives for decades. Other recent interests include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Hardware Security:</strong> FIDO2, OpenSK, and physical keys.</li>
				<li><strong>Home Lab:</strong> Raspberry Pi automation and self-hosting.</li>
				<li><strong>Development:</strong> Python scripting and automated workflows.</li>
			</ul>
