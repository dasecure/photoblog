# Introduction

Hojicha is a roasted Japanese green tea prized for its nutty aroma, low astringency, and warm amber infusion. When paired with a delicate sweet cream, the result is a harmonious balance of toasty tea notes and silky texture. In this guide, we'll explore the technical fundamentals of brewing the best hojicha and crafting a stable sweet cream topping. Whether you're a seasoned barista or a home-brewing enthusiast, these steps will help you consistently recreate a café-quality beverage.

# Why Hojicha Works with Sweet Cream

- **Low Astringency**: Roasting degrades catechins and tannins, yielding a smooth mouthfeel that complements dairy.
- **Toasty Aromatics**: The Maillard reaction during roasting produces bis­phenolic compounds and pyrazines, adding depth that sweet cream can highlight.
- **Temperature Tolerance**: Unlike delicate green teas, hojicha can be steeped at higher temperatures without bitterness, facilitating heat-stable cream foams.

# Equipment and Calibration

Consistency hinges on precision. Here’s a list of recommended tools:

- **Scale**: 0.1 g resolution for tea and cream.
- **Thermometer**: ±1 °C accuracy for water and milk.
- **Timer**: Digital timer with second increments.
- **Brewing Vessel**: Ceramic or heat-retentive glass.
- **Milk Frother or Steam Wand**: Capable of reaching 60–65 °C in under 30 s.

Calibrate your scale and thermometer weekly. Check water hardness with a TDS meter; target 50–70 ppm for optimal extraction.

# Ingredients

1. **Hojicha Leaves**: 4 g of high-grade loose leaf.
2. **Water**: 200 mL filtered, 85 °C.
3. **Heavy Cream** (35–40% fat): 60 g.
4. **Granulated Sugar**: 8 g (13% weight of cream).
5. **Optional Stabilizer**: 1 g of powdered milk or cream of tartar for foam stability.

# Step 1: Brewing the Hojicha

1. Preheat your vessel by rinsing with 90 °C water.
2. Measure 4 g of hojicha and place it in a filter basket or infuser.
3. Heat 200 mL filtered water to **85 °C**. Rapid heating (e.g., electric kettle) preserves aromatics.
4. Pour water evenly over the leaves, ensuring full saturation. Start the timer immediately.
5. Steep for **30 seconds**. Monitor infusion time precisely to avoid over-extraction.
6. At 30 s, decant the tea into a serving cup or carafe. Yield should be approximately 180 mL (accounting for leaves absorption).

Extraction note: An ideal total dissolved solids (TDS) reading for hojicha is 0.3–0.4%. Adjust steep time by ±5 s or tea weight by ±0.2 g to dial in strength.

# Step 2: Preparing the Sweet Cream

A stable sweet cream foam will float above your tea and create an appealing visual contrast.

1. Chill the mixing bowl to 5 °C to slow protein denaturation.
2. Combine 60 g heavy cream, 8 g sugar, and optional stabilizer in the bowl.
3. Using a whisk or low-speed mixer, aerate until soft peaks form:
   - Target temperature: **5–8 °C** (check with thermometer).
   - Whipping time: **45–60 s** at low speed to minimize over-aeration.
4. Transfer the cream into a squeeze bottle or stainless-steel pitcher for controlled pouring.

Pro tip: Over-whipping raises fat globule aggregation, causing phase separation. Monitor texture carefully.

# Step 3: Assembly and Serving

1. Pour the freshly brewed hojicha into a 250 mL glass, filling to about 80% volume.
2. Slowly dispense the sweet cream over the back of a spoon held just above the tea surface. Aim for a 20:80 cream-to-tea ratio by volume.
3. Allow the cream to settle and form a distinct layer. This takes 15–20 s.
4. Serve immediately with a straw for optimal layering effect.

# Troubleshooting and Consistency Tips

- If the cream sinks too quickly, your foam is under-aerated. Increase whisk time by 5–10 s.
- If the cream separates or becomes grainy, reduce whipping time or lower sugar percentage.
- If the tea tastes bitter, lower water temperature by 2–3 °C or shorten steep time by 5 s.
- Record each batch’s parameters (temperature, time, weight) in a simple log to refine your process.

# Conclusion

By applying precise measurements, maintaining equipment calibration, and respecting the chemistry of tea extraction and dairy foaming, you can achieve a consistently excellent hojicha with sweet cream. Experiment with slight parameter adjustments—such as TDS, cream fat percentage, and sweetener types—to discover your signature variation. Enjoy this sophisticated yet approachable beverage any time you crave a warm, aromatic tea treat with a luxurious finish.
